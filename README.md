# Linked-List-Using-Java
This repo contains the implementation of Single Linked List using Java.
Single Linked List is a fine example of Linear Data Structure where the data is represented in a sequential manner and the nodes are interconnected either as a sequence or the node pointers, as for Single Linked List nodes are connected using the next node pointers. And the starting and the ending of the node is handled using Head and Tail pointers.

In the presented Single Linked List Implementation, I have tried to implement all the functionalities I can think of which includes:
1. Adding at front
2. Adding at rear
3. Adding using position index

4. Delete at front
5. Deleting at rear
6. Deleting using position index

7. Getting the elements in array[Ordered]
8. Getting the elements in array[reverse order]
9. Deleting all the occurances of an element.

Feel free to use this implementation in any way possible and if found any error do rectify by pulling a new request.
